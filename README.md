Plugin allows you to connect your veadotube model to tosu and have it automatically update states when you miss or FC.

You need to keep your tosu dashboard tab open while this is in use - the OBS browser source doesn't have all the functionality for this to work natively.

Does PNGplus have plugins that use websockets? Maybe we add support for that next idk let us know
